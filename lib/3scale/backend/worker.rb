    # Worker for working off background jobs. This is very stripped down version of the
    # default resque worker with parts of code shamelessly stolen from it. The reason for
    # this stripping is that the resque one does fork before processing each job, and that
    # is too slow.

    # This is a module that's meant to be included from the different workers.
    # Now we have WorkerSync and WorkerAsync. Those classes need to implement
    # #work, which is responsible for fetching jobs from the queue and running
    # them by calling perform(job).
